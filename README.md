# udacity_nlp_disasterresponse
My answers to the project on responding to SMS messages sourced from disaster response situations by Figure Eight so as to build ETL &amp; NLP pipelines. The end result is a supervised machine learning algorithm that helps classify messages both in terms of urgency and the specific domain (e.g. water, health, etc.) that the message pertains too.
